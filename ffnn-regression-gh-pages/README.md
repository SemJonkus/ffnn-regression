# FFNN Regression - Deep Learning Aufgabe

This project implements a Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) for regression tasks using TensorFlow.js. The main goal is to approximate a mathematical function using synthetic datasets, both with and without noise.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML document that structures the content of the website. It includes sections for data visualization and model predictions, as well as links to external libraries like TensorFlow.js and Chart.js.
  
- **main.js**: Contains JavaScript code for data preparation, model training, and visualization of results. It manipulates the canvas elements defined in `index.html`.

- **style.css**: Defines the CSS styles for the website, including layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance of the HTML elements.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ffnn-regression-gh-pages.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```
   cd ffnn-regression-gh-pages
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in a web browser**:
   You can simply double-click the `index.html` file or open it using a web server for better performance.

## Usage

- The website visualizes the performance of the FFNN on synthetic datasets.
- It displays predictions for both training and test datasets across different scenarios (clean data, noisy data, best-fit, and overfitting).
- The results are presented in interactive charts using Chart.js.
